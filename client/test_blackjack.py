class FlaskAppTest(TestCase):
    """
    A class representing test cases for the Flask application.
    This class inherits from Flask_Testing's TestCase class and
    provides methods for testing various aspects of the Flask application,
    including starting a game, hitting, and standing.
    Attributes:
        app (Flask): The Flask application to be tested.
        deck (Deck): A deck of cards used in the game.
        player_hand (list): The player's hand in the game.
        dealer_hand (list): The dealer's hand in the game.
    Methods:
        create_app(self):
            Create and configure the Flask application for testing.
        setUp(self):
            Initialize the deck, shuffle it, and set up the player and
            dealer hands.
        tearDown(self):
            Clean up after each test.
        test_start_game(self):
            Test that the game starts correctly and returns the initial
            player and dealer hands.
        test_hit(self):
            Test that hitting results in a new card being added to the
            player's hand.
        test_stand(self):
            Test that standing results in the dealer's hand being revealed.
